Hi foo
# Version 5.0.2

 * Reactor warnings and sounds can have an optional core distance cap
 * No more infinite wave skipping because it breaks stuff
 * On spawn/death/ctrl clicking a core, always spawn at the highest tier core available.
 * Changed formatting of changelog and feature lists, its now aligned to the left and text wraps instead of scrolling horizontally (ur welcome red soul)
 * Option to not clear chat when leaving a world and joining another (ur welcome again red soul)
 * New core attack warnings in chat display the exact position of the core being attacked.
 * Optionally broadcast core attack warnings to entire lobby

# Version 4.0
 * New smart build path (keybind: ;) that will build things based on priorities (whatever you place > broken buildings > teammate placement queues > anything that isnt finished, also does stuff it can afford first)

 * Numerous crash fixes
 * Many fixes to the unit picker
