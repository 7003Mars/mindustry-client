Hi foo
# Version 4.0
 * New smart build path (keybind: ;) that will build things based on priorities (whatever you place > broken buildings > teammate placement queues > anything that isnt finished, also does stuff it can afford first)
 * Hide all units so you can actually see stuff (hold: o to activate)
 * Numerous crash fixes
 * Many fixes to the unit picker
 * Reactor warning now shows player name again
 * Units in formation are now only 30% opaque
 * Auto-bridge improvements
 * Clicking and dragging with bridges now spaces them at max distance rather than creating a chain of them
 * Holding SHIFT will disable any placement modifiers (auto bridge and bridge spacing etc.)
 * I think i added more stuff but i dont even remember what i added lol

# Version 3.0.2
 * Added flying unit trails (toggleable in client settings)

# Version 3.0.1
 * Minor bug fixes

# Version 3.0
 * Added client player display (allows other foo's users to see you, off by default)
 * Added setting to highlight messages from other foo's users
 * Added auto updater (there is a setting if you find it annoying)
 * Changelog now opens after updating to a new client version
 * Added client command system as well as various commands (type !help for more info)
 * Made alt click menu scale correctly when more buttons are added
 * Player spectate option (camera will follow player)
 * Navigate to player option (uses pathfinding algorithm to avoid enemies)
 * Made assist stay a fixed distance away from the target to avoid drifting into them
 * Added unit picker/sniper which will switch to the specified unit as soon as it is available
 * Improved various timers (stuff will actually update at the specified intervals if your fps isnt 60)
 * Wave skipping in campaign is slightly weird currently
 * Ghosts of blocks that are broken by enemies are now visible on servers
 * Updated to v115.0
 * Probably more stuff I forgot

# ​
# Version 2.4
 * Tile logs persist over /sync (does not work for server-forced sync)

# ​
# Version 2.3
 * Improved turret range showing performance

# ​
# Version 2.2
 * Added turret range display bound by default to backtick (`)

# ​
# Version 2.0
 * UI tweaks:
 * Improved top left UI (the one with player hp and wave info)
 * Power bars, boss bar, waypoint button moved to said UI
 * Waypoint button added into UI
 * UI visible even when waves are disabled on server
 * FPS display now also displays player count when on a server

 * ​
 * Antigrief + Assist:
 * Reactor warnings improved
 * Added sound to reactor warnings (can be toggled in settings, can only play after 10s of no reactor construction)
 * Reactor warns from chat to toasts (the same thing that the boss in x waves, core under attack messages use)
 * Assist vastly improved, now mimics shooting, mining
 * Doesn't get as close to assisted player, should hopefully reduce the likelihood you from pushing other players

 * ​
 * Misc:
 * Added changelog I guess
 * Added client tab to main menu, currently it only has the discord, changelog and feature lists
 * Added easier way to increment client version (you wont notice this change but now foo might actually increment it lol)
 * Version text now contains a release date
 * Alt click "menu" looks good now
 * Alt click "menu" now shows mouse coords as well as block type (for now you can use these coords to find where camera is when freecamming)
 * Probably more stuff I missed

 * ​
 * TODO:
 * Attempt to move the core item list to the top left UI or somewhere else that wont get covered by toasts
 * Clean up the code for all of the new stuff
 * Remove some old commented out code if everything is working correctly
 * Make tile config rollback display some sort of success message, maybe a toast?
 * Move power split notifs to toasts (not really important but would be nice)
 * Update feature list (tbf i didnt add any new stuff so..)
